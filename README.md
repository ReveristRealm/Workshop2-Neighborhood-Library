# Workshop2-Neighborhood-Library

Hello to whome this may concern,

This program is suppose to duplicate an actual library program that runs in the command Line.

When you start the program there is a home screen that will give you three options, you can see available books or you can see the checked out books.
Once you see the available books, you can then check your book out from there, you can also go back to the home screen from this menu.
Also when you go into the checked books section, you can see the books and who they are checked out by. From this menu you can check the books back in by ID.

                case 1:
                    System.out.println("---------------------------");
                    showBooks();
                    System.out.println("---------------------------");
                    AvailableBooksProcess();
                    break;
                case 2:
                    System.out.println("---------------------------");
                    showOutBooks();
                    checkedOutBooksProcess();

This code is the most interesting to me becuase I put most of the code into methods to condense the main method code length.
